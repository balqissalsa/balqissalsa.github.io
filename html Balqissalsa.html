<h1 align="center" style="background-color: salmon";><strong>MY PROFILE</strong></h1>
<img src="img/Profil Balqis">
<p style="background-color: pink"; ><font color="black">	Chiao Everyone! my name is <strong>Balqis Salsabila Santoso</strong>, and prinses is my middle name. kidding, you can call me Balqis. I'm born at 24 February 2001, i'm an "Bogorian" and that's because i born there, and live there 'til now. i'm a student of SMK-SMAK BOGOR. i'm very grateful to be the SMAKBO's student because people here are really friendly and always support me in every situation. My hobby is filling my brain with new things. confused? why don't we move into the next part?</p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="black">My weird hobbies</h2>
	
<p style="background-color: pink";> 	I hate math, physics, and chemistry. i hate numbers and reaction. but there are few things that i like to fill my brains. i like biography, history, and invention, espescially public experiments. Youtube is my bestfriend to learn those things. at first, i really like to read books. but as i get older i don't have time to read books anymore. so, Youtube video is the solution. BBC is the best documenter maker, and it is my favorite youtube channel. WHY I LOVE THEM? because after i do my hobbies I felt more valuable as a human. and i'm sure that hobby is good for me, that's why i love them. i like to make poems and write them on my diary. i write diary regularly to express my feeling and not thinking about them too much. sometimes, making poem is better than write my diary as usual, that's why I love them.
</p>
<h2 align="center">My Future Goals</h2>
<p style="background-color: pink";>		Ok, this one is the hardest topic. Analyst? ok, that's maybe what I will be after I graduate frrom here. but that's not my dream. I wanna be more than that, I want to change this world to something better, to sound the truth, to fix every problem in this world. I want no more hunger, no more unemploymenter, no more wrong handling of trash, and safe the nature. A president? an activis? or Analyst? what ever is that, i will chase it. fore the better future.</p>
